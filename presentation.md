## Giving social networking back to _you_

^ Tonight I’m going to be talking about a social network called Mastodon.

---- 

# It’s just like _Birdsite_

^ Mastodon is just another microblog network with a different slang, you toot instead of tweet, and it has a 500 character limit instead of 140.

---- 

# Mastodon’s _Awesomeness_

^ But it has some awesome features that traditional microblogs don’t have.

---- 

# Privacy and _Safety_

^ For a lot of people social networks aren’t doing enough to protect people from harassment and have no interested in protecting your privacy.
This has made Twitter an unwelcoming environment for many people.

^ Mastodon offers better tools for privacy and fighting harassment than any other social networks.
This is done though a superior blocking system (that can be by the user or instance) and a community of people who actually care.
Also allowing users to mark their content with Content Warnings and NSFW tags allows for a better community to foster.

---- 

# Open Source

^ Mastodon is currently be developed on GitHub under the GNU Affero license.
Which means you can run your own Mastodon instance today for your community or in single user mode.

---- 

# Decentralised

^ Mastodon uses the OStatus platform for decentralisation which allow an individual instance to connect to the “feedverse” of instances.
OStatus is a combination of multiple W3C Social Activity standards.
